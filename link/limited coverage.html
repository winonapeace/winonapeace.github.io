<h1> J-Rock Exposed: Limited US coverage</h1>

<p> Whenever a band travels overseas, it's mainly to add it to their resume in Japan, not to reach out to possible fans outside of their home country. As smaller indie bands are able to perform at anime conventions, bigger bands are limited to either doing a tour, a festival with big-name artists, or attending a convention with 100,000 attendees. That being said, they aren't concerned with the US or any other country learning about thier performances, but would rather have <a href="favor japanese media.html"> Japanese media </a> bring the story of their performance in a foreign country back home to say how great they were. All to "keep the fans happy."</p>

This favoritism leads to <a href="minimal us interviews.html"> minimal to no US interviews </a> and ultimately <a href="no us photographers.html"> no US photographers </a>.
