<h1> J-Rock Exposed: Paying Press</h1>

Paying Press to publish articles

Rather than the press receiving money from the government or other sponsors, the press is directly sponsored by recording labels. The more money the label makes, the bigger the media it can afford to hire to cover its shows. It's very rare that a truly indie, unsigned band would have the moneys needed to acquire press coverage, so there is a goal for bands to be signed to a label (however big) within the first year or two of their debut to ensure that they will be able to gain some kind of exposure outside of their live venue performances.
