<div class="text">

<h4 class="q1"> A resident’s right to choose how to live out their life. </h4>
<p class="a1">Also called an Advanced Directive. It is legal document stating how one would wish to live out their life so they may pass on with dignity.</p>


<h4 class="q2"> Make sure your resident understands all of the medical procedures. </h4>
<p>Communication with your resident is key. 
If they are given an unwanted treatment because they did not know what it was, then it will be going against their living will. And you could be sued for malpractice. A living will will address some of the following:
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
  <li>
  Resuscitation
  </li>

  <li>
  Mechanical Ventilation
  </li>

  <li>
  Tube feeding
  </li>

  <li>
  Dialysis
  </li>

  <li>
  Anti-biotics or anti-viral
  </li>

  <li>
  Comfort care
  </li>

  <li>
  Organ, tissue, and/or body donations.
  </li>
</ul>

</p>


<h4 class="q3"> It is imperative that you heed your resident’s wishes.  </h4>
<p class="a3">This allows them to be at peace and lowers their stress. Some residents wish to respect their cultural beliefs, and rely on you to ensure that that is possible.</p>


<h4 class="q4"> In some cases, a legal document is not necessary. </h4>
<p class="a4">Residents will tell you or their physician if they do not want to be resuscitated (DNR) or intubated (DNI). Be sure to check their file and discuss it withthem if it is not mentioned.</p>

<p>Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) are also included in the files of individuals that are diagnosed with a serious illness. This is written to ensure that an individual’s wishes for certain care are fulfilled in the event of an emergency.</p>
